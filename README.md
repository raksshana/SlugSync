# SlugSync



The problem many UCSC students face, especially Freshmen, is finding events to connect with others to make friends/socialize. To find UCSC club events, students must research on Instagram by searching for each club and determining where/when the event is taking place. We have personally faced this problem, as we were unable to find some of the events we wanted to attend, and ended up missing out on a great opportunity. But now, with our app, students don't need to worry about any of this, as our app, SlugSync is a one-stop destination that centralizes all of the events into one place and gives a description about the event while showing the whereabouts of the event. 

As we briefly stated above, some major effects caused by this problem are missing out on great opportunities because students simply do not have the time to or do not know how to, find each club event on Instagram that they want to go to. Another effect of this problem is a lower turnout rate at the actual event, as many people may not be able to find the events on Instagram. With SlugSync, club owners/reps can also add their own events to the app so students can find them easily, leading to a higher turnout rate.                                

The target audience of our app is UCSC students. SlugSync is specifically designed for UCSC events to be posted on it for UCSC students to attend. 

Students would use SlugSync because of the easy-to-use UI/UX that we have, leading them to remember all of the events since they're all in one spot, which also reduces the amount of time students spend scrolling through multiple Instagram accounts. Through SlugSync, students can also find new clubs/events that they never knew about, since all of the events happening will be in one centralized spot. 

# Tech Stack

Frontend – Swift (iOS App):
The app’s user interface is built using Swift, Apple’s programming language for iOS development. It handles everything users see and interact with — like buttons, event listings, and swiping features. Swift provides a smooth, fast, and native experience on iPhones and iPads.

Backend – FastAPI (Python):
The backend is powered by FastAPI, a modern and high-performance web framework for Python. It processes requests from the app, such as logging in users, fetching event data, and storing user preferences. FastAPI is known for being fast, easy to scale, and great for building APIs that communicate with mobile apps.

Database – SQL:
All the app’s data — like user accounts, events, and preferences — is stored in an SQL database. This ensures that data is organized, easily accessible, and secure. The backend connects to the database to read or update data whenever needed.

Deployment – Render:
The FastAPI backend and database are deployed on Render, a cloud platform that hosts web apps and APIs. Render keeps the backend running online 24/7, so the iOS app can connect to it anytime. It automatically manages scaling, updates, and uptime.
