# SlugSync
An app to track events on the UCSC campus for ACM Hacks

What is the problem we're solving?

The problem many UCSC students face, especially Freshmen, is finding events to connect with others to make friends/socialize. To find UCSC club events, students must research on Instagram by searching for each club and determining where/when the event is taking place. We have personally faced this problem, as we were unable to find some of the events we wanted to attend, and ended up missing out on a great opportunity. But now, with our app, students don't need to worry about any of this, as our app, SlugSync is a one-stop destination that centralizes all of the events into one place and gives a description about the event while showing the whereabouts of the event. 

What are the effects of the problem?
